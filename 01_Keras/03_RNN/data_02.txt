Nowadays, divorce rate has been rising sharply in China, because most people think that
it's better to get divorced than stick to a bad marriage. But for those couples who have
children, they had better think over before getting divorced. Parents' divorce may have
some negative effects on their children. Firstly, the love of father is different from the
love of mother. Children need both of the love. Without each of the love, they may not
grow up healthily. Secondly, in order to raise the family, the single parents have to
work harder, so that they may have less time to accompany with their children. The
children may feel neglected, which may cause mental problems. Besides, if the single
parents get married again, the children may get hurt by calling another person father
or mother. If they can't get along well with each other, the situation will become even
worse. Thus, for the sake of their children, parents are not supposed to get divorced in
a rush. They should think twice.
Almost everyone wants to live a long life, but longevity is not for all people. It is
reported that most long life people are in villages, far away from big cities. In village,
life is closer to nature. The sky there is clear and pretty; the air is fresh; the water
is clean; and the food they eat are natural, without any chemicals. Besides, those
villages are abundant in green trees, beautiful flowers, fresh fruit, and wild animals,
which can evoke people's passions for life. Moreover, the living pace in those villages
is rather slow. People suffer less stress than cities’. Thus, they have more freedom to
enjoy what they like. No wonder that most villagers are strong and healthy. If I become
old someday, I would like to move to village to enjoy a more comfortable and pleasant
life.
Nowadays, many female students are idolaters. In order to chase after their idols, they
always do extreme ways. For example, they listen to their idols' songs almost every minute
in their daily life. With a smart phone, they do it when reading books, doing homework,
 having meals, and even walking on the road, which may have many bad effects on their
 health and even cause safety problems. Besides, plenty of girls think they like their
 idols so much that they chase after their idols wherever they go, just to get their
 signatures. They also daydream of dating with their idols and get psychological
 problems at last. All of these are worth our attention. We should educate girls that
 their idols are some people who are lucky enough to be famous, and listening to their
 songs and watching their photos are the things they should do in their life. Thus,
 they are supposed to balance chasing after idols and their daily life properly.
The happiest memory in my childhood was making snowman with my friends. As I was a
little boy, I always went out with my friends to make snowmen and play with snow when it
snowed heavily. We divided ourselves into several groups, two or three people in each
group. Then, we began to make our own snowman. We used buttons to be snowman's eyes
and carrots for its nose. After making our snowman, we compared ours with others’ to
decide whose snowman is the best. Sometimes, we wrapped our scarfs around snowmen or
put our caps on their head, so as to make our snowman more beautiful. The last time
I making a snowman was when I was in university. But it snowed rarely these years.
Thus, making snowman has become the long-lost fun for me. How I hope it would be snowy
this winter!
My birthday is on May 19th. I often celebrate it with my friends. Usually, I have a
good party at home with a few close friends. We sit together, singing, chatting,
eating snacks, and having drinks. My friends always buy me some nice gifts, make birthday
cards, and prepare a big birthday cake for me. The happiest moment is absolutely the
moment I open the gifts, as I can get a big surprise every time. In the evening, we
often have a big meal at a restaurant. We have many delicious dishes. After the meal,
we will have the birthday cake. My friends always light the candles on the cake and
sing "Happy Birthday" to me. Then I close my eyes, cross my fingers, and make a wish.
After I blow out the candle, I cut the cake and share it with my friends. All of us
feel joyful on that day. Although I celebrate my birthday in this way every year, I
never feel bored, because I enjoy having fun together with my friends so much.
Before I went to high school, I was so looking forward to the coming of Children's Day,
because it belonged to kids and I could enjoyed the great atmosphere with my classmates.
Usually the teachers prepare us some funny games, such as play ping pong and guess
riddles. If we win the game, we can get some candies as the prizes. So the one who
receives the most prizes will be the shining star, because he or she is very excellent.
I am very interested in guessing riddles, so I will focus my attention on and figure
out the answers. When the teachers give me the candy, I am so proud of myself. Now I am
in high school and Children's Day is not that popular. I miss the old time. But at the
same time, I am so eager to be independent.
High school is a very important stage for every Chinese student, because they will study
and fight for their future together. When the college entrance exam is over, it means
the end of this stage. Some may go to college and some may choose to work. No matter
what the choice they make, they need to be separated and begin the different chapter
of life. My classmates decided to make a great appointment. We would meet in the
school in twenty years. At that time, we could see the change of the school and talk
about our school time. Though we would soon to be apart, we looked forward to the
future meeting and wouldn’t feel sad. Thinking about the unknown future, we were
excited and scared, but we believed that we could get over and became the better ones.
April 4th is the Tomb-sweeping Day in China, which is one of the most important
traditional festivals. The young people will come back home and sweep tomb with their
families. The meaning of Tomb-sweeping Day is to honor the ancestors and it has more
than 2500 years' history. Chinese people pay special attention to remember their
ancestors, so no matter how far they are, they always know where they are from. When
they are old, they will return to the place where they are from. It is a good tradition.
The sense of belonging makes people feel safe. What's more, the relationship between
relatives makes the whole family become stronger, because people are united by the
same ancestors. Thus, they treat each other as families and give support all the time.
What a great tradition it is.
Our school is far away from the downtown. As a result, it is a good place for
students to study. We won’t be disturbed by the crowded people and the noise. For me,
I like the scenery in the campus, trees are around, especially when I look out of the
window in the break time. I will look at the scenery that is far away, sometimes I can
see birds flying. There is a road that circles the mountain, which looks like a snake.
When cars are driving in the road, I will be wondering who is coming, maybe our parents
or just some strangers. The scenery outside the window provides me another world. I like
to think about a lot of questions and sometimes my thought will go around the mountain.
This is my little world.
As a small child, I always wanted to grow up soon, so that I could make my own
money and became independent. So I had worked so hard to let my parents to realize that
I have grown up, such as washing my clothes and taking care of myself. Indeed, I won
respect step by step. Finally, when I went to high school, they allowed me to live in
school. I felt so happy to move out. When I lived in school, strangely, I started to
miss my parents and wanted to see them. I spent so much time to get away from them,
but when I did it, I felt lost. This is my story about growing up, I believe most
children struggle running away from their parents, but when they really grow up,
they will miss the ones who love them.

enjoy what they like. No wonder that most villagers are strong and healthy. If I become
old someday, I would like to move to village to enjoy a more comfortable and pleasant
life.
Nowadays, many female students are idolaters. In order to chase after their idols, they
always do extreme ways. For example, they listen to their idols' songs almost every minute
in their daily life. With a smart phone, they do it when reading books, doing homework,
 having meals, and even walking on the road, which may have many bad effects on their
 health and even cause safety problems. Besides, plenty of girls think they like their
 idols so much that they chase after their idols wherever they go, just to get their
 signatures. They also daydream of dating with their idols and get psychological
 problems at last. All of these are worth our attention. We should educate girls that
 their idols are some people who are lucky enough to be famous, and listening to their
 songs and watching their photos are the things they should do in their life. Thus,
 they are supposed to balance chasing after idols and their daily life properly.
The happiest memory in my childhood was making snowman with my friends. As I was a
little boy, I always went out with my friends to make snowmen and play with snow when it
snowed heavily. We divided ourselves into several groups, two or three people in each
group. Then, we began to make our own snowman. We used buttons to be snowman's eyes
and carrots for its nose. After making our snowman, we compared ours with others’ to
decide whose snowman is the best. Sometimes, we wrapped our scarfs around snowmen or
put our caps on their head, so as to make our snowman more beautiful. The last time
I making a snowman was when I was in university. But it snowed rarely these years.
Thus, making snowman has become the long-lost fun for me. How I hope it would be snowy
this winter!
My birthday is on May 19th. I often celebrate it with my friends. Usually, I have a
good party at home with a few close friends. We sit together, singing, chatting,
eating snacks, and having drinks. My friends always buy me some nice gifts, make birthday
cards, and prepare a big birthday cake for me. The happiest moment is absolutely the
moment I open the gifts, as I can get a big surprise every time. In the evening, we
often have a big meal at a restaurant. We have many delicious dishes. After the meal,
we will have the birthday cake. My friends always light the candles on the cake and
sing "Happy Birthday" to me. Then I close my eyes, cross my fingers, and make a wish.
After I blow out the candle, I cut the cake and share it with my friends. All of us
feel joyful on that day. Although I celebrate my birthday in this way every year, I
never feel bored, because I enjoy having fun together with my friends so much.
Before I went to high school, I was so looking forward to the coming of Children's Day,
because it belonged to kids and I could enjoyed the great atmosphere with my classmates.
Usually the teachers prepare us some funny games, such as play ping pong and guess
riddles. If we win the game, we can get some candies as the prizes. So the one who
receives the most prizes will be the shining star, because he or she is very excellent.
I am very interested in guessing riddles, so I will focus my attention on and figure
out the answers. When the teachers give me the candy, I am so proud of myself. Now I am
in high school and Children's Day is not that popular. I miss the old time. But at the
same time, I am so eager to be independent.
High school is a very important stage for every Chinese student, because they will study
and fight for their future together. When the college entrance exam is over, it means
the end of this stage. Some may go to college and some may choose to work. No matter
what the choice they make, they need to be separated and begin the different chapter
of life. My classmates decided to make a great appointment. We would meet in the
school in twenty years. At that time, we could see the change of the school and talk
about our school time. Though we would soon to be apart, we looked forward to the
future meeting and wouldn’t feel sad. Thinking about the unknown future, we were
excited and scared, but we believed that we could get over and became the better ones.
April 4th is the Tomb-sweeping Day in China, which is one of the most important
traditional festivals. The young people will come back home and sweep tomb with their
families. The meaning of Tomb-sweeping Day is to honor the ancestors and it has more
than 2500 years' history. Chinese people pay special attention to remember their
ancestors, so no matter how far they are, they always know where they are from. When
they are old, they will return to the place where they are from. It is a good tradition.
The sense of belonging makes people feel safe. What's more, the relationship between
relatives makes the whole family become stronger, because people are united by the
same ancestors. Thus, they treat each other as families and give support all the time.
What a great tradition it is.
Our school is far away from the downtown. As a result, it is a good place for
students to study. We won’t be disturbed by the crowded people and the noise. For me,
I like the scenery in the campus, trees are around, especially when I look out of the
window in the break time. I will look at the scenery that is far away, sometimes I can
see birds flying. There is a road that circles the mountain, which looks like a snake.
When cars are driving in the road, I will be wondering who is coming, maybe our parents
or just some strangers. The scenery outside the window provides me another world. I like
to think about a lot of questions and sometimes my thought will go around the mountain.
This is my little world.
As a small child, I always wanted to grow up soon, so that I could make my own
money and became independent. So I had worked so hard to let my parents to realize that
I have grown up, such as washing my clothes and taking care of myself. Indeed, I won
respect step by step. Finally, when I went to high school, they allowed me to live in
school. I felt so happy to move out. When I lived in school, strangely, I started to
miss my parents and wanted to see them. I spent so much time to get away from them,
but when I did it, I felt lost. This is my story about growing up, I believe most
children struggle running away from their parents, but when they really grow up,
they will miss the ones who love them.
Nowadays, divorce rate has been rising sharply in China, because most people think that
it's better to get divorced than stick to a bad marriage. But for those couples who have
children, they had better think over before getting divorced. Parents' divorce may have
some negative effects on their children. Firstly, the love of father is different from the
love of mother. Children need both of the love. Without each of the love, they may not
grow up healthily. Secondly, in order to raise the family, the single parents have to
work harder, so that they may have less time to accompany with their children. The
children may feel neglected, which may cause mental problems. Besides, if the single
parents get married again, the children may get hurt by calling another person father
or mother. If they can't get along well with each other, the situation will become even
worse. Thus, for the sake of their children, parents are not supposed to get divorced in
a rush. They should think twice.
Almost everyone wants to live a long life, but longevity is not for all people. It is
reported that most long life people are in villages, far away from big cities. In village,
life is closer to nature. The sky there is clear and pretty; the air is fresh; the water
is clean; and the food they eat are natural, without any chemicals. Besides, those
villages are abundant in green trees, beautiful flowers, fresh fruit, and wild animals,
which can evoke people's passions for life. Moreover, the living pace in those villages
is rather slow. People suffer less stress than cities’. Thus, they have more freedom to
enjoy what they like. No wonder that most villagers are strong and healthy. If I become
